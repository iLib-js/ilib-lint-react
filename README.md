# ilib-lint-react

An ilib-lint plugin that provides the ability to parse React files and 
provides rules to check resources that come from code written in React.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev ilib-lint-react

or

yarn add --dev ilib-lint-react
```

Then, in your `ilib-lib-config.json`, add some configuration:

```
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "filetypes": {
        "jsx": {
            "ruleset": [ "react" ]
        }
    },
    "paths": {
        "src/**/*.jsx": "jsx"
    }
```

Please note: nodejs version 14 or above is required to run ilib-lint, as it
is written with ESM modules.

## Rules

The following rules apply to any resources from any file type, but are
designed to check resources that come from react code:

- source-formatjs-plurals - check that any React-intl style plurals have
  correct syntax

## RuleSets

This plugin defines one ruleset `react` that will turn on all the rules
that this plugin supports. Users may rely on this ruleset when defining their
file types.

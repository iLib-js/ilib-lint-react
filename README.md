# ilib-lint-javascript

An ilib-lint plugin that provides the ability to parse javascript files and 
provides rules to check resources that come from code written in javascript.


## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev ilib-lint-javascript

or

yarn add --dev ilib-lint-javascript
```

Then, in your `ilib-lib-config.json`, add a script:

```
    "plugins": [
        "javascript"
    ],
```

Please note: nodejs version 14 or above is required to run ilib-lint, as it
is written with ESM modules.

## Rules

The following rules apply to any resources from any file type, but are
designed to check resources that come from javascript code:

- resource-javascript-params-match - check that any javascript-style substitution
  parameters (like "{name}") that appear in the source string also appear in the 
  target strings.
- resource-javascript-legacy-match - check that any legacy javascript-style substitution
  parameters (like "%(name)s" or "%(name)d") that appear in the source string
  also appear in the target strings.
- resource-javascript-template-match - check that any Template class-style substitution
  parameters (like "$name" or "$age") that appear in the source string
  also appear in the target strings.

## RuleSets

This plugin defines one ruleset `javascript` that will turn on all the rules
that this plugin supports. Users may rely on this ruleset when defining their
file types.
